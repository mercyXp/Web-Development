# Exercises to Help You Master the Syntax

## TASK 1: LOOPING A TRIANGLE
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

## TASK 2: FIZZBUZZ
Write a program that uses console.log to print numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions:
1. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5(and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
2. When you have that working, modify the program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5(and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

[This is actually an interview question that has claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates, so if you solved it, your labour market just went up]

## TASK 3: CHESSBOARD
Write a program that creates a string  that represents an 8 x 8 grid, using newline characters to separarte lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space  or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
```
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # # 
```
