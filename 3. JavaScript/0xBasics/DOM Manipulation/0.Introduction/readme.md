## What is DOM?

```
The DOM is an organization chart, created automatically by the browser when your web page loads, for the whole web page. All the things on your web page—the tags, the text blocks, the images, the links, the tables, the style attributes, and more—have spots on this organization chart. This means that your JavaScript code can get its hands on anything on your web page, anything at all, just by saying where that thing is on the chart. What's more, your JavaScript can add things, move things, or delete things by manipulating the chart. If you wanted to (you wouldn't), you could almost create an entire web page from scratch using JavaScript's DOM methods.
