## 🎓 Course Title:

**Introduction to APIs: Understand and Build Your First API**

---

## 🕒 Duration:

**4 Modules (1 week course, or self-paced)**
Each module: \~1.5–2 hours (including practice)

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives:

By the end of this course, learners will:

* Understand what an API is and why it's important.
* Learn about HTTP, endpoints, and REST principles.
* Use tools like Postman to test APIs.
* Build their own simple REST API using Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express).
* Understand basic security and documentation practices for APIs.

---

## 📚 Course Outline:

---

### **Module 1: What is an API?**

**Goal:** Understand the concept and real-world examples of APIs.

#### Topics:

* What is an API (Application Programming Interface)?
* Real-world analogies (e.g., restaurant menu, remote control).
* Types of APIs: Public, Private, Partner.
* REST vs SOAP (focus on REST).
* Common terms: Request, Response, Endpoint, Method.

#### Activities:

* Interactive quiz: Match API concepts to examples.
* Watch a demo: Using a weather API in a browser.

#### Tools:

* Presentation slides
* YouTube/embedded video explanation

---

### **Module 2: How APIs Work**

**Goal:** Understand how data flows in APIs using HTTP.

#### Topics:

* HTTP basics: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
* JSON: structure and usage.
* Understanding endpoints and routes.
* Status codes (200, 400, 404, 500).

#### Activities:

* Use Postman to send a GET and POST request.
* Practice modifying parameters in API URLs.

#### Tools:

* Postman (or Insomnia)
* Sample Public APIs (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or Reqres)

---

### **Module 3: Build Your First API**

**Goal:** Create a basic API using Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express).

#### Topics:

* Setting up a local development environment.
* Writing a simple "To-Do" API (CRUD operations).
* Routing and controllers.

#### Activities:

* Step-by-step lab: Build a To-Do List API
* Code walkthroughs
* Optional: Host on Render or Replit

#### Tools:

* Python + Flask OR Node.js + Express
* Code editor (VS Code)
* GitHub (optional for version control)

---

### **Module 4: Testing, Securing & Documenting APIs**

**Goal:** Understand good practices in using and building APIs.

#### Topics:

* Using Postman to test endpoints.
* Simple authentication with API keys or tokens.
* Basic input validation.
* Writing API documentation (Swagger or simple Markdown).

#### Activities:

* Add basic validation to the To-Do API.
* Write an API ReadMe or Swagger spec.

---

## 🧪 Final Project:

**Build a mini API** (e.g., a Book Tracker or Notes App)
Requirements:

* At least 3 endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE)
* JSON responses
* Postman test collection
