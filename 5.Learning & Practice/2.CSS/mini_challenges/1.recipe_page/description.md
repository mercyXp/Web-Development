# Recipe page

```
This challenge will help you focus on writing semantic HTML. Ensure you think through what HTML elements are most appropriate for each piece of content.
```

## 📝 Brief
Your challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Where to find everything
Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the /design folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin.
