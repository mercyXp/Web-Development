# HTML Basics 
## Headings in HTML

### What Are Headings?

Headings are used to create titles and subtitles on a web page. They organize content by importance, helping readers and search engines understand the structure of your page.

### Heading Tags

HTML provides six levels of headings:

- `<h1>` — Most important heading (usually page title)
- `<h2>` — Section heading
- `<h3>` — Subsection heading
- `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>` — Lesser importance subheadings

### Why Use Headings?

- Improve **readability** by breaking content into sections.
- Help with **SEO** by signaling key topics.
- Assist **screen readers** to navigate content easily.

### Example

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
```
## Paragraphs in HTML
### What Are Paragraphs?
Paragraphs group sentences together as a block of text. They make content easier to read by visually separating ideas.

Paragraph Tag
Use the `<p>` element to define a paragraph.

Browsers add spacing automatically before and after paragraphs.

Example
```html
<p>This is the first paragraph of my website. It introduces the main ideas.</p>
<p>Here is another paragraph with more detailed information.</p>
```

## Exercise: Create Your Own HTML Page
Open a text editor (like VS Code).

Create a new file named index.html.

Add the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Add your headings and paragraphs here -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### Inside the `<body>`, add:

- An `<h1>` heading with the title of your choice.

- An `<h2>` heading for a section.

- Two `<p>` paragraphs with any text you like.

- Save and open index.html in your web browser to see your work!

### Summary
- Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` to organize page content hierarchically.

- Use `<p>` to group text into readable paragraphs.

- These elements are essential for semantic, accessible, and SEO-friendly HTML.
