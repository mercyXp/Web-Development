### 📌 What is Flask?

**Flask** is a **web framework** written in **Python** that helps you create websites and web applications easily.

You write your code in Python, and Flask helps you show that code in a browser like Chrome or Firefox.

### 🧱 What is a Web Framework?

A **web framework** is like a toolbox that makes it easier to:

* Run a web server
* Display pages (HTML)
* Handle forms and uploads
* Add logic to your site

Flask gives you all of this — in a small, simple package.

### ⚙️ Why Use Flask?

* ✅ It’s **simple** — great for beginners
* ✅ It’s **lightweight** — you only add what you need
* ✅ It’s written in **Python** — which you already know!
* ✅ It’s good for **small projects** or even **big apps**

### 💡 What Can I Build with Flask?

* File upload sites (like a document converter ✅)
* To-do lists
* Simple blogs or dashboards
* REST APIs (for mobile or frontend apps)
* Admin tools for bigger systems

### 📌 Real-World Example

Imagine someone uploads a `.docx` file on your site.

Here’s what Flask does:

1. Shows a form in the browser
2. Takes the uploaded file
3. Converts it using Python
4. Sends the new file back to the user

Without Flask, doing this in raw Python would be much harder!

### 🔚 In Summary

* Flask is **not a language** — it’s a **web framework** for Python.
* It helps you build websites and web apps easily.
* It’s perfect for small projects like file converters.
