    <img src="pancake.jpg">
    <p>These classic pancakes are light, golden, and perfect for any morning — whether you're fueling up for a productive day or enjoying a lazy Sunday brunch. Follow this easy recipe to make the ultimate stack of soft, buttery pancakes with a crisp edge and tender center.</p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p><i>A measuring cup of flour, a jug of milk, eggs, and a whisk beside a sizzling skillet on a stovetop.</i></p>
    <h2>📝Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk (preferably whole)</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>   
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg, then mix in milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined — it’s okay if the batter<i>[<b>Batter</b> is a flour mixture with liquid and other ingredients such as sugar, salt, egg, milk and leavening used for cooking.]</i> is slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and edges look set (about 2–3 minutes).</li>
            <li>Flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with maple syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>👩‍🍳Pro Tip</h3>
    <p>For extra fluffiness, let the batter rest for 5–10 minutes before cooking!</p>
