# 🍽️ Recipe Page

Build a simple and semantic HTML page that showcases your favorite recipe. This project is part of freeCodeCamp's HTML labs and focuses on applying fundamental HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Recreate a functional and accessible **Recipe Page** using only HTML. Your page should introduce a recipe, list its ingredients, and provide clear instructions — all using semantic HTML elements.

Try not to copy the example project directly. Add your own creative style, favorite dish, and personal flair!
