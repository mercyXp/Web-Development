## Web Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of web development projects I've built while learning and mastering frontend, backend, and full-stack development. Each project focuses on different technologies, frameworks, and concepts to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web development tools.
