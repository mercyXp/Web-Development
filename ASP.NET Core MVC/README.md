# ASP.NET Core MVC

ASP.NET Core MVC is a framework for building modern, dynamic web applications. It provides a structured way to create websites or web apps by organizing code into three main components: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**.

## What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core is:
- A fast, cross-platform framework for building web apps.
- Designed to work on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Suitable for small websites as well as large, high-performance applications.

## What is MVC?

MVC stands for **Model-View-Controller**. It’s a design pattern that helps organize your app into three distinct parts:

1. **Model**  
   Represents the data and business logic of your application.  
   Example: In a shopping app, the Model could handle product details and pricing.

2. **View**  
   Manages the user interface and what the user sees.  
   Example: The web pages, buttons, and visual elements users interact with.

3. **Controller**  
   Acts as the middleman between the Model and View.  
   It processes user input (e.g., button clicks), communicates with the Model, and determines what the View should display.

By dividing your app into these three components, MVC makes your code easier to manage, maintain, and scale over time.
